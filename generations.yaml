    description: "The original Hyundai Veloster was a unique asymmetrical sport compact, featuring an unconventional three-door design with one door on the driver's side and two doors on the passenger side. Built on a modified Accent platform, it featured distinctive styling with a low, wide stance, aggressive front fascia, and a sloping roofline leading to a glass hatch. Initially powered by a 1.6L naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing 138 HP, with a turbocharged version added in 2012 boosting output to 201 HP. Transmission options included a six-speed manual or a six-speed dual-clutch automatic. The interior featured a driver-focused cockpit with motorcycle-inspired cues, a standard 7-inch touchscreen (large for its time), and surprising practicality given its sport compact positioning. Despite its modest base power, the Veloster earned praise for its handling, unique styling, and value, attracting younger buyers seeking something different from conventional hatchbacks. A mid-cycle refresh in 2015 updated the styling and features, while the Turbo model received a performance-oriented Rally Edition with sportier suspension tuning. This generation established the Veloster as Hyundai's distinctive sport compact entry, emphasizing individuality and fun-to-drive character over outright performance."

  - name: "Second Generation"

    end_year: 2022
    description: "The second-generation Veloster maintained its signature asymmetrical three-door layout but featured more refined styling with sharper lines, a more aggressive stance, and improved proportions. Built on a new platform shared with the i30/Elantra GT, it offered significantly improved driving dynamics and chassis stiffness. Engine options evolved to include a 2.0L naturally aspirated four-cylinder base engine producing 147 HP and a revised 1.6L turbocharged four-cylinder with 201 HP in Turbo models. The performance-focused Veloster N joined the lineup with a 2.0L turbocharged engine producing up to 275 HP and a comprehensive chassis, brake, and aerodynamic package developed by Hyundai's N performance division. The interior saw major improvements in material quality, design, and technology, featuring an available 8-inch touchscreen with advanced connectivity options and improved ergonomics. Despite the enhancements and critical acclaim (particularly for the Veloster N), declining sales in the sport compact segment led to most versions being discontinued after 2021, with only the N variant continuing for one additional year in the US market. This generation, particularly the N model, played an important role in transforming perceptions of Hyundai from a value-oriented brand to one capable of producing genuine performance vehicles, with the N division's expertise later expanding to other models in Hyundai's lineup."
